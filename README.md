# <p align="center">JJSploit-UI-Source</p>
This repo is the extracted Electron source from the `./resources/app.asar` archive, relative to your local [JJSploit](https://wearedevs.net/) installation.  Originally a fork of [Stan2474's version of the same name](https://github.com/stan2474/jjsploit-ui-source2), I made a new repository (this one) to allow the search indexer to visit the new code.  I also included a update script in the event a new version of JJSploit's UI comes out.
